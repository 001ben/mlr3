# mlr3 0.1.2

* Added functions to ease the creation of objects stored in dictionaries:
  `tsk()`, `tgen()`, `lrn()`, `rsmp()`, `msr()`.

* `BenchmarkResult` now ensures that the stored `ResampleResult`s are in a
  persistent order. Thus, `ResampleResult`s are now addressed by their position
  instead of their hash.

* New field `BenchmarkResult$n_resample_results`.

* New field `BenchmarkResult$hashes`.

* New method `Task$rename()`.

* New S3 generic `as_benchmark_result()`.

* Renamed `Generator` to `TaskGenerator`.

* Removed the control object `mlr_control()`.

* Removed `ResampleResult$combine()`.

* Removed `BenchmarkResult$best()`.

# mlr3 0.1.1

* Initial upload to CRAN.
